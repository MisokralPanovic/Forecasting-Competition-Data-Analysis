ICEWS counts are best viewed as a dynamic index of news coverage for a given event/country pair and are most informative when considered in relation to past values for the same country and code(s). ICEWS event data are extracted from the Factiva news database, which draws from a multilingual roster of over 6,000 news sources from around the world. These event data are then assigned event type codes (such as 190 – “Use conventional military force”) based on the <a href=""http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/cameo.dir/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf""target=""_blank"">Conflict Events and Mediation Observations (CAMEO)</a> event codebook.

- ‘CAMEO code’ is three digits equal to 19x or four digits equal to 19xx (where x=any number 0-9);
- ‘Country’ is country of interest;
- ‘Source.Country’ and ‘Target.Country’ are the countries of interest (in no particular order);
